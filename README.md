Download Filer
==============

Version: 0.1

Eventually, this will be a Firefox extension that allows you to file
your downloads into different folders based on a regular expression
that matches against the file name.

Right now, it does not do any of that. All it does is run
console.log() when a download is completed. This is just a skeleton.
It is not ready for use!
